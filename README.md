## Introduction
Welcome to my redesigned version of the "Build and Deploy a Responsive Website" project! As a passionate web developer, I have taken inspiration from the original tutorial and recreated the project with my own personal touch.


In this project, I have focused on creating a modern and fully responsive HTML & CSS website enriched with captivating animations. By following the steps outlined below:
 
- Utilizing CSS variables for improved code flexibility and maintainability.
- Importing CSS files into other CSS files to streamline the organization of styles.
- Leveraging flexbox and position properties in CSS to achieve flexible and responsive layouts.
- Implementing smooth and subtle animations to elevate the user experience.
- Adhering to the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention for clear and structured CSS code.
- Maintaining a well-organized file and folder structure for efficient project management.
- Embracing the principles of writing clean and optimized code to ensure readability and scalability.
